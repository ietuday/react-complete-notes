# Store



Well this all seems well and good but how does a reducer fit in with a having a global store of data? Well reducers are used as the access point to our global state. It's a way to protect the global state if you will. If we didn't use a reducer to manage our global state then potentially anything could change and we would quickly loose control. Let's show how we can let reducers handle our global state.

Imagine that we have a function `dispatch` that is our entry point for changing the global state. Let's sketch it out:

```js
const dispatch = (action) => {
}
```
Ok, so we take to input parameters `action`. The job of `dispatch` is to take an action and make sure it finds the correct reducer and have that reducer calculate a new state. What we do we mean by the right reducer? Well here is the thing. A reducer only operates on a slice of state, it never manages the entire state. There is usually one reducer for our property of our state object. Let us show this in code:

```js
{
  list: listReducer(state.list, action),
  user: userReducer(state.user, action)
}
```
As you can see above we can connect every property of our state object with a reducer function. Of course the above isn't valid code so what we need to do is to put this in a function, like so:

```js
const calc = (state, action) => {
  return {
    list: listReducer(state.list, action),
    user: userReducer(state.user, action)
  };
}
```

Now we can connect this to our `dispatch` function like so:

```js
const dispatch = (action) => {
  state = calc(state, action);
}
```

As you can see above we also introduce a `state` variable that is nothing more than the state of our store. It looks like this:

```js
let state = {
  list: [],
  user: void 0
}
```
Our full code so far therefore looks like this:

```js
let state = {
  list: [],
  user: void 0
}

const calc = (state, action) => {
  return {
    list: listReducer(state.list, action),
    user: userReducer(state.user, action)
  };
}

const dispatch = (action) => {
  state = calc(state, action);
}
```

Now the above is the very engine in Redux. This is how we can send a message, have it processed via a reducer and finally the state changes accordingly. There are of course other things to this like:

- ability to select a slice of state
- notify listeners.

## Select a slice of state

A component is not going to be interested in the entire state object but merely a slice of it. To cater to this we need a select function that has the ability to select a slice of the object. That is quite simple thing to do so let's add that to our code:

```js
const select = (fn) => {
  return fn(state);
}
```

As you can see above we give it a parameter `fn` and end up return `fn(state)` and thereby we let the input parameter decide what slice of state it wants. Let's showcase how we can call the `select` method:

```js
select((state) => state.list) // returns the list part only
select((state) => state.user) // returns the user part only
```

## Notify listeners

Last but not least we need a way to communicate that our state has changed. This is easily achieved by using letting a listener subscribe, like so:

```
let listeners = [];

const subscribe = (listener) => {
  listeners.push(listener);
}
```
Then to notify all the listeners we need to call all these listeners when a change to our state happens, we need to place some code in the `dispatch`:

```js
const dispatch = (action) => {
  state = calc(state, action);
  listeners.forEach(l => l()); // calls all listeners
}
```

Ok so the full code now looks like this:

```js
// store.js

let state = {
  list: [],
  user: void 0
};

let listeners = [];

const listReducer = (state = [], action) => {
  switch(action.type) {
    case 'CREATE_ITEM':
      return [ ...state, { ... action.payload}];
    case 'REMOVE_ITEM':
      return state.filter(item => item.id !== action.payload.id);
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

const userReducer = (state = {}, action) => {
  switch(action.type) {
    case 'LOAD_USER':
    case 'UPDATE_USER':
      return { ...state, ...action.payload }
    default:
      return state;
  }
}


const calc = (state, action) => {
  return {
    list: listReducer(state.list, action),
    user: userReducer(state.user, action)
  };
}

export const dispatch = (action) => {
  state = calc(state, action);
  listeners.forEach(l => l()); // calls all listeners
}

export const subscribe = (listener) => {
  listeners.push(listener);
}

export const select = (fn) => {
  return fn(state);
}
```

## Example

So far we have described how you can build a store from scratch. How do you use it in practice though?

Imagine you have the following components:
- create item component
- list component

When a `create item component` is create a new item, it needs to express this as an action and call `dispatch` on the store, like so:

```js
// create-action.js
export const createItem = (item) => ({ type: 'CREATE_ITEM', payload: { title: item } })


// create-item.js
import { createItem } from './create-action';
import { dispatch } from './store';

class CreateItem extends React.Component {
  state = {
    content: ''
  }

  create() {
    // to be defined
  }

  onChange = (evt) => {
    this.setState({
      content: evt.target.value
    });
  }

  onCreate = () => {
    dispatch(createItem(this.state.content));

    this.setState({
      content: ''
    });
  }

  render () {
    return (
      <React.Fragment>
        <input onChange={onChange}>
        <button onClick={onCreate}>Save</button>
      </React.Fragment>
    );
  }
}
```

So much for the create-item component, what about the list component, how does it listen to the store and how does it handle updates to the store?

```js
// list-component
import { select, subscribe } from './store';

class ListComponent extends React.Component {
  state = {
    list: []
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    this.setState({
      list: select((state) => state.list)
    });

    subscribe(this.update.bind(this));
  }

  update = () => {
    console.log('store is updated');
    this.setState({
      list: select((state) => state.list)
    });
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <React.Fragment>
        <h3>My list</h3>
        {this.state.list.map(item => <div>{item.title}</div>)}
      </React.Fragment>
    );
  }
}
```
We answered both those questions with the code above, we initially fetch the store value we care about in the `componentDidMount` like so:

```js
this.setState({
  list: select((state) => state.list)
});
```

we also listen to the store by calling `subscribe` and passing our `update` method like so:

```js
subscribe(this.update.bind(this));
```

lastly when `update` is invoked we make sure to reread the state slice we care about by calling it again, like so:

```js
this.setState({
  list: select((state) => state.list)
});
```
