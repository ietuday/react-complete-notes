# Mocking HTTP calls with Nock



Nock is used to mock calls to HTTP. It makes it possible for us to specify what URLs to listen to and what to respond with. This is a fairly short article that shows how you use the library `nock`.


In this article we will cover:

- **set up**, setting up a `nock` and specify a mock response
- **query parameters**, see how we can set up our `nock` with query parameters
- **verification**, we should always verify that our `nocks` where hit. If they weren't then something changed and we need to change our tests to reflect that

## Scenario

Imagine we have the following files:

- **products.js**, a service that can retrieve data for us
- **ProductsList.js**, a component that calls a method on products.js to get data and render that

Let's have a look at what these two modules look like:

```js
// products.js

export const getProducts = async () => {
  const response = await fetch('http://myapi.com/products');
  const json = await response.json();

  return json.products;
}
```

Above we can see that we do a `fetch()` call to url `http://myapi.com/products` and thereafter we transform the response snd dig out the data `products`. Let's have a look at the component:

```js
// ProductsList.js

import React from 'react';
import { getProducts } from '../products';

const Products = ({ products }) => (
  <React.Fragment>
  {products.map(p => <div>{product.name}</div>)}
  </React.Fragment>
);

class ProductsContainer extends React.Component {
  state = {
    products: [],
  }

  async componentDidMount() {
    const products = await getProducts();

    this.setState({
      products
    });
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <Products products={this.state.products} />
    );
  }
}

export default ProductsContainer;
```

We can see that we use `product.js` module and call `getProducts()` in the `componentDidMount()` and end up rendering the data when it arrives.

## Testing it
If we wanted to test ProductsList.js module we would want to focus on mocking away `products.js` cause it is a dependency. We could use the library `nock` for this. Let's start off by installing `nock`, like so:

```js
yarn add nock
```

Let's now create a test `__tests__/ProductsList.js` and define it like the following:

```js
// __tests__/ProductsList.js

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import ProductsList from '../ProductsList';
import nock from 'nock';

it('renders without crashing', () => {
  const div = document.createElement('div');
  ReactDOM.render(<ProductsList />, div);
  ReactDOM.unmountComponentAtNode(div);
});
```
Let's see first what happens if we don't set up a `nock`:

We end up with the following:

As you can see from the above it attempts to perform a network request. We should never do that when running a test. We could add a Jest mock for this that is definitely one way to solve it, then it would look like this:

```js
// __mocks__/products.js
export const getProducts = async () => {
  const products = await Promise.resolve([{ name: 'test' }]);
return products;
}
```

That works but let's look at how to solve it with `nock`. Because we are attempting to call `fetch()` in a node environment we need to ensure it is set up correctly. Suggestion is to set up the `global.fetch` and assign `node-fetch` to it, like so:

```js
// setupTests.js
global.fetch = require('node-fetch');
```
Let's now add `nock` to our test, like so:
```js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import ProductsList from '../ProductsList';
import nock from 'nock';

it('renders without crashing', () => {
  const scope = nock('http://myapi.com')
  .get('/products')
  .reply(200, {
    products: [{ id: 1, name: 'nocked data' }]
  }, {
    'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*',
    'Content-type': 'application/json'
  });

  const div = document.createElement('div');
  ReactDOM.render(<ProductsList />, div);
  ReactDOM.unmountComponentAtNode(div);
});
```

Note above how we invoke the `nock()` method by first giving it the baseUrl `http://myapi.com` followed by the path `/products` and the HTTP verb `get` and how we define what the response should look like with `reply()`. We also give the `reply()` method a second argument to ensure `CORS` plays nicely. At this point our test works.:

## Query parameters
What if we have a url that looks like this:

```
http://myapi.com/products?page=1&pageSize=10;
```
How we do we set up our `nock` to match it? Well, we can use the helper method `query` for that, like so:

```js
nock('http://myapi.com')
.get('/products')
.query({ page: 1, pageSize: 10 })
```

## Verify your mock/s
It's considered best practice to verify that the mocks you have set up are being hit. To do that we can call `done()` on the returned reference when we are calling `nock` like so:

```js
const scope = nock('http://myapi.com')
.get('/products')
.reply(200, {
  products: [{ id: 1, name: 'nocked data' }]
}, {
  'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*',
  'Content-type': 'application/json'
});


scope.done();
```

So what happens when we set up a mock and it's not being it? Well let's add another call to our test, like so:

```js
const users = nock('http://myapi.com')
.get('/users')
.reply(200, {
  products: [{ id: 1, name: 'user' }]
}, {
  'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*',
  'Content-type': 'application/json'
});
```

Now it looks like this:

## Block HTTP calls
You should never let a HTTP call happen for real so therefore make sure to shut off that ability. We can do so by adding the following line to `setupTests.js`:

```js
// setupTests.js

import nock from 'nock';
nock.disableNetConnect();
```

## Summary
We have briefly explained what `nock` is and how to use it for different cases. This is just one way of many to handle HTTP calls.

There are a lot more you can do with `nock`, we have barely scraped the surface. Have a look at the official documentation [Nock documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nock)
