# Contribute by translating lessons

We welcome translations for the lessons in this curriculum!

## Guidelines

Translated lessons should follow this naming convention:

**README._[language]_.md**

where _[language]_ is a two letter language abbreviation following the ISO 639-1 standard (e.g. `README.es.md` for Spanish and `README.nl.md` for Dutch).
